        <h1 class="text-6xl font-bold">A short story</h1>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            Once, in a small village bordered by a forgotten forest, there lived a young girl named Elara. She loved to explore. Each day was a new adventure. Her favorite spot was the forest's edge, where wildflowers grew in abundance. But she never went too far. Old tales warned of a hidden garden lost within the woods. It was said to be enchanting, yet perilous.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            One crisp autumn morning, Elara found a curious, winding path. It was new. Or perhaps, just unnoticed before. Leaves crunched underfoot. The wind whispered. "Come," it seemed to say. So, she followed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            The path twisted and turned. Elara’s heart raced with excitement. Birds sang overhead. Their song was sweet. A melody of mysteries untold.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            After what felt like hours, the path opened up. Elara gasped. Before her lay the forgotten garden. It was real. Walls of ivy gleamed under the sun’s gentle touch. Flowers of every imaginable color bloomed wildly. The air buzzed with the magic of unseen life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            In the heart of the garden stood an ancient fountain. It was dry, covered in moss. Elara approached, drawn by an inexplicable force. She reached out. The moment her fingers brushed the stone, water burst forth! It gushed into the air, sparkling like diamonds in the sun.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            Elara stumbled back, stunned. The garden awakened. Vines danced. Flowers swayed. A soft voice hummed with the breeze. "Thank you," it whispered.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            Elara spent the day in the garden. She talked to the flowers and listened to the trees' old tales. As the sun set, the garden’s glow dimmed. It was time to leave. She knew this place was a secret meant for keeping. With a heavy heart, she walked back to the village.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            Years passed. Elara grew up. But she kept the secret of the garden. She visited often. Each visit was a new discovery. A new story. And in her heart, the garden remained—alive, magical, and silent. Waiting. Always waiting for her return.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl">
            And so the world turns. Seasons change. But some tales, like the forgotten garden, are timeless. They live on. Whispered in the wind. Carried in the heart of those who dare to wander. And believe.
