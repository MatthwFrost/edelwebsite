                    Readel's got some new paint. I have updated the UI, added some new buttons (such as Purchase credits & Updates) and removed ones I didn't think added
                    any value.

                    criteria the button needs to meet. The page needs atleast 300 characters and for 
                    some websites like OpenAi's <a href="https://chat.openai.com" class="underline">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com" class="underline">Youtube</a> has been disabled as 
                    I don't have an implementation for these yet. However, you are still able to use the highlight-read feature.</p>

                <p class="update-desc">
                    Previously, there was no way to tell if you were signed in to Readel. Which, doesn't help, as the whole program fails if you aren't signed in.
                    I have added a new method, if the first method (Sign in on install) fails. You will also be notified if you aren't signed in and you will be prompted to do so.
                    *NOTE* You can view your email via Readel's extension pop up.
